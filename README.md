Extends available steam deck refresh rate options

**Running hardware outside of factory specifications may reduce lifespan and/or cause damage**

I am not responsible if your Steam Deck dies prematurely or any other damage occurs to it.

Be prepared to restore your Steam Deck using a recovery image if installation goes wrong or other problems arise.

Usage/Installation:

1. Enter desktop mode
2. Download install-rre.sh
3. From terminal, run `sudo ./install-rre.sh`
4. Return to Gaming Mode


Ensure that you have Unified Frame Rate / Refresh Rate Limiter enabled

Tested working on SteamOS 3.5.7, other versions may not work

Available Refresh Rates:

LCD Panel Deck: 40-70Hz
BOE OLED Panel Deck: 40-120Hz [Theoretical Bandwidth Limit is ~133Hz]
SDC OLED Panel Deck: **Untested** 40-120Hz [**Theoretical Bandwidth Limit is ~100Hz**]


If you are at Valve and would like to incorporate part/all of my changes into gamescope/SteamOS, I would appreciate being contacted first.
